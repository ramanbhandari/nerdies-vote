# Voter Registration
- Service to handle admin requests for registering voters
- Structure:
  - main.go 
  - /pkg
    - /auth
      - signer.go 
    - /voting 
      - voting.go

main.go:
- contains the logic of the microservice 

packages:
- signer.go:
  - provides a helper function to generate a signed transaction (auth) object, encapsulating the private key and chain ID
  - An auth object is required when interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network
  - The auth object includes the private key needed to sign the transaction, proving ownership of the address sending the transaction.
    - Signing Transactions:
      To interact with a smart contract or perform any transaction on Ethereum, the transaction needs to be signed by the sender. 

- voting.go:
  - generated by abigen command-line tool in the Go-Ethereum.
    - abigen takes an Ethereum contract’s ABI (Application Binary Interface) and Byte code to generate a Go package with type-safe methods that match the contract’s functions and events allowing developers to interact with the contract in a Go program easily.
  - This package created by abigen abstracts the process of building and sending transactions to the contract, making smart contract calls simpler.
